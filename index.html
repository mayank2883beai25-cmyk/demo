  <h1>Happy Birthday, Madam Ji! </h1>
  <div class="message">
    Happy Birthday, Jaana. Jab se tu meri life mein aayi hai it has been much better from the time when you were not here and i love it. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me this year. 
    Sometimes when i feel low or not good you are always there for me and i hope you will be always in the coming years. You became my best friend not so fast not so late just at right time and i could share some of the wierd things i did with you and not felt embarassed you can say.
    And everytime i missed you, i just see your pic for sometime and later i miss you more and its a bad habit of me ig. You became my world and everytime i see your smile, i feel that i am the luckiest person. Everytime i see in your eyes i just get mesmerized in it.
    I'll always listen to your heart. I'll never stop caring, no matter what. I'll always choose you, every single day. I promise to stay with you always loving you, stand by you through every high and low, and to keep you happy always.
    We do fight sometimes, get angry and even stop talking for a while. But no matter what, we always find our way back to each other because this bond means more than any fight ever could.
    I got addicted to you somehow and you are the most hottest and dangerous addiction and this addiction i will never quit. When we meet i will give you alot of hugs and kisses and wanna cuddles with you 
    Every moment with you feels like a small piece of our forever. we've laughed,dreamed together and this is just the beginning. No matter where life taks us, I'll always hold these memories close.
    So today, on your birthday, i just want to thank you for being in my life, being here for me always,for loving me and for making like beautiful. You are my world, my love and i will love you more with each passing day 
    Ig kaafi lamba hai yeh to ya if you read this whole call me and get your GIFT. I LOVE YOU MERI RASMALAI MUAHHHHHHHH
